As part of my mobility semester at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, I developed this Simulink + MATLAB model of a robot which learns through RL how to navigate a pregenerated warehouse.

This repository contains all the files from the project, including multiple reward functions and both pretrained and untrained agents.
